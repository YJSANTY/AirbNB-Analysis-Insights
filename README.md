A correlation analysis will be performed between sentiment polarity and various property attributes and host services metrics.

Sentiment Analysis First, you need to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis can be accomplished using a library such as NLTK in Python.

Correlation Analysis Once we have sentiment scores for each review, we can examine their correlation with other factors. These factors could be numerical or categorical attributes related to the Airbnb listings, such as price, number of bedrooms, location, host response time, cleanliness rating, etc.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular topic modeling technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. LDA assumes that documents are mixtures of topics, and topics are mixtures of words. By analyzing the distribution of words across documents, LDA can identify underlying topics.

Topic modeling will be used to determine the main themes or topics covered in the reviews. 

Correlation analysis is a method used to evaluate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. When it comes to sentiment analysis, the sentiment (often quantified as a score between -1 and 1 or 0 and 1) can be correlated with other quantitative factors to understand relationships.
